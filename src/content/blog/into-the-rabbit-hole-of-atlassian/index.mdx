# Into the Rabbit Hole of Atlassian
My first week at Atlassian as a Developer Intern has been a mix of 
every emotion, but boring. I’ve waited in gleeful anticipation for 
the past 6 months to begin what would be a foot in the door of my software 
development career. And what a large step it was! Over a turbulent and 
action-packed week, I’ve had the chance to meet my team of hard-working 
and creative individuals, get settled deep in the monolithic codebase and 
attempt my first Jira ticket.

## Induction
My first day began with waking-up prematurely three times at 3am, 5am and 6am, 
which signified my bubbling enthusiasm. I settled into my desk with an 
Atlassian-branded water bottle, my new work MacBook Pro and an open mind for 
opportunities that would come my way. The feeling was likened to the first day 
of school, as you were thrusted into a deep sea of unknown faces and routines. 
The intern Discord channel welcomed our morning confusion, as a dozen of us 
hopped on a voice channel before orientation began (with Lo-Fi and chill beats, 
of course) to set-up our work laptops and ice-breakers. During the induction Zoom 
call, we went through the expectations of what the internship would entail, payroll, 
a history of the company, as well as a “getting to know each other” session. 
Not a full day has passed,  and our recruiters already have set up a development 
panel with past Interns and Grads to share their unique experiences in what would 
be a pass of wisdom.

## Teamwork makes the dream work
Atlassian’s internship program doesn’t hold back on promising fulfilling and 
career-enriching opportunities; within my second day, I was already involved 
in standup meetings with my team and my opinions and input were taken on board 
with their sprint planning. I was told I could pester my mentor any time for 
advice and help, and the rest of my team would stop whatever they were doing 
to assist me with overcoming any kind of obstacles. Whether it was a Kotlin 
concept, how the overarching application worked or fixing a sneaky bug, the 
readily available support system wholly represent Atlassian’s company values 
as an “open company” and “play as a team”.

My issues consisted mainly of the repository set-up and dependencies, I still 
recall fondly my mentor and I struggled to bootRun the application in the last 
hour of the first day, which he said “We’ll try again tomorrow”. Work-life was 
an important value for Atlassian, and this episode reminded me that even the 
brightest minds can be stuck and it’s normal to feel overwhelmed. I was offered 
a chance to fix a Jira ticket that would affect staging instances on the **third day**, 
which I instantly said yes to. Through a long-winded learning process, I was 
able to create progress and learn Kotlin, however my efforts ended up only 
becoming a learning experience. The Jira ticket I was assigned had an unavoidable 
design flaw that would be a hassle to fix, in which there would be better challenges 
that would best suit my time.

Despite all of this, I am excited to begin my second week with a new challenge: 
my intern project! (or whatever new Jira ticket the team assigns me)
