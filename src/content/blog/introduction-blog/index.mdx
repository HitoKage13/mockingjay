# Introduction Blog
Hi there! My name is Jeremy and Iâ€™m in my 3rd year at UNSW studying 
Commerce and Computer Science, majoring in Finance! Iâ€™m working at 
Atlassian as a full-stack Developer intern for the summer! I hope to be 
able to learn a lot of industrial practices, meet great Atlassians and to 
have a lot of fun along the way

## See Es Eee
My love for coding started after an introductory course into programming 
released TWO assignments based around building the best AI that can compete 
against other students in games. Thereâ€™s a healthy mix of competition and 
opportunities to be able to problem solve creative solutions during my time 
working with code. Since then, Iâ€™ve self-taught myself React and JavaScript to be 
fairly proficient in front-end, learnt databases and networks to have a solid 
grasp in the back-end, but my weakness will always be the UI ðŸ˜¢

## At Last, Ian!
During a CSESoc site visit in my first semester of university, the Atlassian 
office was the last stop, and I was beyond amazed at how aesthetically pleasing 
the whole building was. I resonated with the Atlassian values and was excited 
at all the little things (like the office names being 80s music!). I set a 
personal goal to get into Atlassian, either as an intern or as a graduate, and 
Iâ€™m so happy I was offered the chance to work for such a wonderful and open company!

## Code! Revue!
I was involved in CSE Revue from 2018 to 2019, which performs a sketch comedy 
show each year (rip 2020) to over 700 people (!), before becoming the 2020 CSE 
Revue President and Producer! In my role, I learnt to work with a dozen 
portfolios and managed sponsorships to fund a theatrical production. Although 
we werenâ€™t able to run the show this year, my team managed to finish the year 
with a surplus financially! Revue is such a quintessential university experience 
that develops interpersonal and performance skills, and Iâ€™m proud to have been 
a part of that community!

## Weird Flex but Okay
I play Pokemon Trading Card Game competitively across Australia and internationally! 
I played in Worlds 2015 (Boston), 2016 (San Francisco) and 2019 (Washington DC), 
received two paid trips and have achieved Top 16 in 2015 Worlds, Top 2 in 2015 
Nationals, 2 Top 8 Regionals and 3 Top 16 Regionals between 2016-2019. Another 
game I play semi-competitively is Hearthstone, most recently winning an AOC monitor 
by coming 1st in the Uni Cup!

I created a Pokemon events website and a Hearthstone companion web app 
that you can find here:

## No Time to Spare
In my spare time, I love photography, hiking and travelling, often with 
great food along the way! Iâ€™ve been playing Final Fantasy 12 on the Switch 
and watching Haikyuu nowadays, so hit me up if you wanna game or talk about anime.

I love organising social events and meeting new people, so please say hi 
if you wanna chat about anything at all!
